First steps with the MagicUWE code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

build.os.properties.template and Template.classpath are templates for
build.os.properties and .classpath.
Please copy and adjust both files and don't commit them to the SVN. 
(eventually you have to delete an existing .classpath file first and 
after you renamed them you sometimes have to SVN-revert them)

Set MDRAW_16_HOME eclipse project variable to your MagicDraw path.

"res" includes all files for the installation of the plugin
IzPack (to bild an installer): http://izpack.org/

"build.xml" is an ant script with self-explanatory target names
(The system variable JAVA_HOME has to point to a jdk installation!)
- Execute ant target buildInstallerWithoutJavadocAndSources
- install res/MagicUWEInstaller/MagicUWEversionInstaller.jar in your MagicDraw directory
- afterwards you can use e.g. execUpdatedMagicDrawWithProject if you only change the code
  and not the plugin files in res/MagicUWEInstaller/plugins.
- if you want to distribute the plugin, you can use
  o buildInstallerWithoutJavadocAndSources (using IzPack) or
  o createZipForMagicDrawResourceManager (if you want to use a zipfile for the MagicDraw Resource/Plugin Manager)
  (the result jar or zip file is located in res/MagicUWEInstaller)

Information about MagicDraw's OpenAPI can be found 
- in the openapi folder in the MagicDraw directory
- in MagicDraw's OpenAPI Forum: https://community.nomagic.com/programmatic-extendibility-f26.html

btw: The init() method is located in src/core/PluginManager.java
debugging information can be found at the beginning of the build.xml file.

Have fun. :-)
